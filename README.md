* This was my first project with computer vision where I watched the first 10 lectures of Stanford's CS231n cours which taught me a lot about the concepts including: activation functions, batch normalization, hyperparameter optimization, weight initialization, regularization and data augmentation
* This led to other projects I've done -- check out https://github.com/ashoukr/computer-vision.git
* Also checkout this project, "Apache Zebra" which will be open-source: https://github.com/ashoukr/zebra.git
